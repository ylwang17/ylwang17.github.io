There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom —— Richard Feynman.

Dr. Yanlei Wang (王艳磊) is an associate professor in School of Chemistry and Life, Renmin University of China. He received his B.S. from University of Science and Technology of China (2012) and Ph.D. from Tsinghua University (2017), and he also conduct research in Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2015). From 2017 to 2024, he worked as assistant and associate processor at Institute of Process Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences. He has received funding from multiple talent programs, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Science Fund Project (Class B) (formerly the Excellent Youth Science Fund), the China Association for Science and Technology Youth Talent Support Project, and the Beijing Science and Technology New Star Program.

His research focuses on nano-confined thermodynamics and green chemical applications. Employing an integrated approach that combines theoretical modeling, molecular simulations, data-driven methods, and experimental validation, he investigates the interactions and microstructures of water, ionic liquids, and other fluid systems under nanoscale confinement. His work aims to develop confinement-enhanced transport-reaction models that support applications in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), energy conversion, biomolecular detection, and related areas—ultimately advancing the development and implementation of advanced green technologies.
